# Education
**PhD in BioMechanical Engineering**  
TU Delft - *Delft, The Netherlands*  
KU Leuven - *Leuven, Belgium*  
Sept. 2019 ‑ ca. Jan. 2024   
  
Thesis title: *Development of ultra‑thin multi‑steerable catheter technology suited for soft‑robotic navigation through complex vascular structures*   
ESR 1 in the [ATLAS‑ITN consortium](https://atlas-itn.eu/project/esrs-description/)  

My research has two main goals: 
1. To combine soft‑robotic actuation with advanced steering technology inspired by clever design principles from nature (octopus, wasp) to develop novel  ultrathin multi‑steerable catheters for navigation through complex lumens.
2. To include knowledge on human depth perception and eye‑hand coordination, to optimize HMIs to allow intuitive control over the  multi‑steerable catheters designs from 3D control actions and 2D CT/MRI images.
  
**MEngSc in Mechanical Engineering (by research)**  
University College Cork - *Cork, Ireland*  
INSA & IHU Strasbourg - *Strasbourg, France*  
Jun. 2016 ‑ Oct. 2018  
  
Thesis title: [*Design and Development of a Catheter Actuation System*](/assets/Thesis.pdf)  
I built and tested a manual actuation handle for a steerable electromagnetically‑guided bronchoscopy catheter, starting from a custom kinematic model of the relationship between steering tendon displacement and catheter tip pose.



**BEng in Biomedical Engineering**  
Cork Institute of Technology - *Cork, Ireland*  
Sept. 2011 ‑ Jun. 2016   
  
Completed my BEng in Biomedical Engineering with First‑Class Honours
  
Final year project: [3D printing soft PVC](/assets/Trauzettel_Fabian_FYP2016.pdf) ‑ I successfully adapted my existing FDM 3D printer to print with a liquid PVC plastisol, allowing the 3D printing of soft (approx. Shore 20A) materials.  

**Leaving Certificate**  
Bandon Grammar School - *Bandon, Ireland*  
Sept. 2005 ‑ Sept. 2011  

Graduated from secondary school with a leaving certificate of 455 (out of a max. 600) points
