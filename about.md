My name is Fabian Trauzettel. Ever since I was a kid I loved to play with Lego, take things apart, and make stuff in the garage with my old man. 

When I was 16, Dad decided that my [transition year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_Year) should be used to do internships and have a look at what I might want to do in the future. Because of my German background, going abroad for internships wasn't an issue and I ended up doing work placements in Airbus' and Daimler's plants in Bremen, as well as three weeks at Dräger in Lübeck. My time at Dräger was far more important to me than I realised at the time. Even though I was only doing production testing work, and shadowing my mentor around the place, I was hooked.

That experience inevitably led me down the path to common-entry engineering in [CIT](http://www.cit.ie/). Actually, biomedical engineering was my first choice, but after struggling with mathematics in my leaving cert and only getting a D1 at higher level, I couldn't enter the course directly. Nevertheless, 19-year-old me decided that, to put it in Corkonian terms, "This'll be graaaaaaand, sure. No hassle, like."

Wrong.

I failed Mathematics 102 and Thermofluids. 

I failed them again in my repeat exams that summer.

Lesson learned: Going to lectures but doing nothing but playing Minecraft in the evenings doesn't work. Go figure.

That particular lesson was painful both emotionally and financially, and finally kicked me in my juvenile ass enough to get myself together. Seeing as I had passed ten out of twelve modules, I strictly only had to retake the two failed courses. However, I figured only six hours of lectures a week was likely to make me go insane out of boredom. So I took extra modules, the electives I hadn't chosen in my first attempt at first year. That allowed me to connect to my new classmates (after all, almost everyone else in my initial class had passed the year). I have to admit, without Will and Adam, I would've probably given up. Will, like me, messed up his first year and had to repeat. We were classmates and already fast friends before disaster struck, and being stuck in the same situation only served to forge it into a true bromance. Speaking of which, Adam joined us as a roommate at the start of our repeat year, at the tender age of 17. He was a total counterpoint to where Will and I found ourselves. He was (and is) something of an enigma to us. Words like "self-doubt" or "can't" simply don't exist in his mind. He is the very model of a doer, and much prefers to ask forgiveness over permission.

This dubious triumvirate just so happened to be a magical combination. Adam provided the energy, Will kept us grounded to reality, and I provided the memes. We were unstoppable.

With the repeat year in the bag with first-class honours, we could finally move on up. There were many laughs, all-nighters, near misses, deadlines, exams and more along the way, but somehow we pulled through together.

In third year, I went to complete my college-mandated work placement at Teleflex, in their plant in Kernen, just outside Stuttgart. It was an enormously rewarding experience - I enjoyed the work, it was a gloriously hot summer, new friends were made, and many beers were had. I won't lie - I got pretty emotional saying goodbye to that place. 

But things move on, and I'm now working towards my Master's degree, this time via [University College Cork](http://www.ucc.ie/en/), although I'm working on my project while abroad, at [IHU Strasbourg](http://www.ihu-strasbourg.eu/ihu/). It's enormously fun, and frustrating at the same time - things don't always work quite the way you want them to.

So here's the soppy punch line of this enormously long and boring wall of text. Shit happens. Things don't go as you hope or expect. Find people you can depend on - friends and family make everything better just by being there, and building good relationships with your mentors and talking to them about what you'd like to do is the key to finding interesting opportunities in your career.
